# Summer Chores
This is part one of a series of exercises based on the "Bro Code" videos. By the end of this series of exercises, you should have three separate JavaScript files in the project.

We will also be using Node for this project. If you have been watching the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript video snippets, you should have seen countless times how to run a JavaScript file with Node. 

If you need a refresher on the process, start the video from the beginning.

#### Part One - Completed the work using callbacks.

#### Part Two - Completed the work using promises.

#### Part Three - Completed the work using async/await
